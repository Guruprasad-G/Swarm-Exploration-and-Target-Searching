Movement of robot:
Two issues.
1) The time step when approximated, leads to short jerks during robot movements.
   If it is not approximated, the delay dose'nt get created.
2) There is a slight deviation in the robots movement that happens everytime, that needs to be corrected.

If these two issues are rectified, then mapping and other functions can be implemented.
